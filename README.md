# 🐾 Hospital for Pets

**Hospital for Pets** is a desktop application built with **Java Swing**, designed to manage a veterinary clinic.  
It allows full CRUD operations for **owners**, **pets**, and **visits**, using a connected **relational database** built according to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.  
The interface is clean, tab-based, and dynamically updates with user actions.

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- Java (Swing GUI)
- **H2 Database** (embedded SQL database)
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- SQL queries
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

## 🗃️ Project Structure

- `Main.java` – entry point of the application
- `MyPanel.java` – GUI tabs
- `DatabaseManager.java` – database connection and queries
- `models/` – data models (Owner, Pet, Visit)
- `resources/` – icons, images, SQL scripts

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema

- `Owners` (Owner details)
- `Pets` (linked to `Owners` via foreign key)
- `Visits` (linked to `Pets` via foreign key)

All tables are properly normalized with no duplicate data or unnecessary IDs. The schema respects 3NF principles.
